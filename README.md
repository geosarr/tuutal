`tuutal` is a library providing tools to optimize functions with scalar or multidimensional inputs.

It aims at the moment to reproduce and improve if possible the optimization submodule of Python scipy 1.13.1.
It is backed by ndarray crate for multidimensional optimization. For compatibility purpose, some of ndarray's objects
are imported into this crate.
