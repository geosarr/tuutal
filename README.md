# tuutal

Optimization library for scalar or multidimensional inputs functions.

It aims at the moment to reproduce and improve if possible the optimization submodule of Python scipy 1.13.1.
It is backed by ndarray crate for multidimensional optimization. For compatibility purpose, some of ndarray's objects
are imported into this crate.
